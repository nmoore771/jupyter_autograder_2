# jupyter_autograder_2
A project to re-implement certain functions of nbgrader for jupyter notebooks.  

This project seeks to decouple the autograding aspects of jupyter's nbgrader extension from the necessity to have Kernels installed for the programming language being autograded.  The intended major features of this extension include the injection of arbitrary code into student answers (in order to establish preconditions and test postconditions), and the automation of certain reporting requirements for the accreditation of engineering programs in Ontario, Canada.
